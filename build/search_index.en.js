is Anchoring?\nAnchoring is a heuristic and cognitive bias people have which is used to simplify thinking and is on display when we need to make estimations. It involves using an already given starting point as a first approximation for constructing and further refining an estimation.\nA classic experiment demonstrating this behavior is to have two groups of students in a classroom estimate the probability of some unknown quantity, say the number of countries who have achieved space travel. Give one group a low percentage like 10% and the other a high starting point like 90% and ask them both to estimate the true percentage. The group with the low starting point will give a low estimate such as 25% and the 90% group will give a comparatively higher estimate, perhaps 60%. \nEven though the initial numbers were compeletely arbitrary and it was communicated that they were arbitrary, nonetheless they served as anchors acting like inertia to hold down future approximations made by the students. [2]\n\nKey Insight #1 - Anchoring acts like inertia or drag constraining estimations around its gravitational center.\n\nSome studies have also indicated that even being trained to have an awareness of anchoring does not fully compensate for these effects. That is, the bias persist even after subjects are informed of it and instructed on how to deal with it.\nHow can Anchoring effect Software Development?\nFirst, a growing body of research has shown that anchoring effects the planning and estimation phase of software development, for instance, Jørgensen and Sjøberg (2004) conducted a study in which they gave CS students and professionals information about customer expectations for a software project. One group was told the clients expected the project to be finished in 50 hours, the other in 1000 hours. Both groups were informed that the client new very little about the time needed and that this information should be considered irrelevant. Still, the anchors influenced both students and professionals, with those estimates of the 1000 hours group much higher than the 50 hours group. Similar research has been replicated by Aranda and Easterbrook (2005), König 2005, and interestingly in Jørgensen and Grimstad 2008, where the later found anchoring in non-numeric values, for instance, describing a project as \"minor extension\" led to significantly low estimates than describing the same project with the wording \"new functionality\". [1]\nSo what is the take away?\nWell, in the context of agile methodologies this is an interesting insight for product owners - to get more accurate estimates for time till task completion, you probably shouldn't make deadlines, timelines or time-based planning goals related to tickets known to team members before you get estimates - if the team knows the ticket has to be finished in 1 week, their estimates are likely going to biased around this anchor, which will lead to lower overall accuracy. Also be aware of how you describe your tickets, and try to avoid language which colors the quality of the ticket (minor change, or major feature for example) and could effect its estimation.\n\nKey Insight #2 - for more accurate developer estimates avoid qualitative language when describing tickets and don't provide time to ticket completion expectations before getting an estimation.\n\nHow can Anchoring effect Data Science?\nOften data scientists and analysts need to take up the work someone else has done or they need to update a series of judgements made by another person or even themselves in the past. This is a prime case where the estimates and calculations done by the predecessor can have an anchoring effect, coloring the data scientist's new judgement.\nOne way to possibly mitigate against this problem is to start from a blank slate and attempt to consciously ignore and disregard the predecessor's estimates. To my knowledge, however, this isn't something that has any body of scientific research supporting it, nevertheless, it could be a useful strategy.\n\nKey Insight #3 - to alleviate anchoring in data estimates, disregard previous judgements and rethink a problem from scratch.\n\nSummary\nSuccinctly, anchoring is the bias of the first impression. The first value, judgement or piece of information we get about a new subject biases our perception and estimation faculties related to this new thing. It can negatively effect software development project estimates and bias judgements made by analysts. Although some evidence exists that says we can't do much to mitigate against it, being cognizant of the bias may help teams to catch it in one another and to take precautions against it during the project planning phase.\nReferences\n\nNumerical anchors and their strong effects on software development\nBiases in Estimating Probabilities\n\n","id":"http://datadao.de/articles/2019/anchoring-bias-in-software-dev/","title":"How Anchoring effects Software Development"},"http://datadao.de/articles/2019/productive-discussions/":{"body":"Often during meetings and discussions in software development and engineering arguments and reasons are put forward for preferring one method over another.\nSomeone may suggest taking one approach and another engineer may ardently prefer a different solution. How can we evaluate each person's reasoning and arguments? It sounds like it might be simple - just evaluate what the person said, break it down into its constituent parts and analyze it. Unfortunately, it is not that simple. We often react to the manner in which things are said, whether loud, angrily, or softly and we bring our own beliefs and current state of mind to the situation - perhaps we didn't sleep well the night before and are just annoyed by the way the person is slowly communicating an idea.\nThese and many more factors cause us to fail to react rationally and keep us from reaching the full productive potential within our discussions.\nConcentrating on the Issue\nOne way to help us navigate the commucation space in a rational way is to think actively think about the issue at hand. The issue is the reason we are having the discussion, the stimulous for the argument, it could be a formal business question such as, \"What is causing customer churn?\" or \"Would a majority of our users be interested in using feature X?\" or \"How much revenue will we have in 2025?\". \nThese are all examples of descriptive issues - they describe the state of the world, or at least present us with a model of the past, current or future state of the world. Its usually easier to maintain level headed discussions on descriptive issues. These are a matter of facts and data and building models based off of that data.\nAt the other end we have prescriptive issues - these describe how the world should be or ought to be. Examples are, \"Should we use programming language X over language Y?\", \"Should we open a new store in city Z?\", or \"What should we do about failing to reach year-to-year growth projections?\". These tend to be more emotionally laden and it can be difficult to discuss the issue rationally.\n\nKey Insight #1 - focus on uncovering the issue and try to determine whether it is a prescriptive or descriptive one.\n\nUncover the conclusion\nIt is impossible to evaluate a set of arguments unless we know the conclusion. Therefore, uncovering the conclusion is just as important as determining the underlying issue. We need to ask, \"What is my interlocutor trying to prove?\" or \"What is their main point?\". Often the conclusion is hidden in a set of statements and can only be inferred, but sometimes its stated up-front, for instance, \"I think we should spend a sprint working to remove technical debt because ...\".\n\nKey Insight #2 - in order to accept or believe a conclusion, all the statements must support that conclusion.\n\nTo illustrate this, imagine the following statement: \"We should hire a new PR manager to better communicate with the press. Why? Because we recently got feedback from someone who said our PR was poor quality.\" Does a single data point justify a new hire? Maybe it does, likely it does not. Who was the person? Was it the CEO of the company? Was it an intern? Does it matter? The main point here is that once you uncover the conclusion: \"We should hire a new PR manager\", and know the issue, \"We have bad press.\" you can evaluate the facts which constitute the issue and the statements supporting the conclusion.\nAlso of importance is that there is a correspondence between issue and conclusion - this may sound fundamental but is often not the case.\n\nKey Insight #3 - ensure there is a direct correspondence between issue and conclusion.\n\nFor instance, \"We should throw more customer events to increase our brand image. Last year our NPS was higher than this year.\" If the issue is a decline in customer loyalty or satisfaction, how does this relate to brand image? Here you would want to dig deeper to discover the true underlying issue and then ask for more statements and arguments for the proposed conclusion given a more refined issue for instance, perhaps the real issue is that some customers left because a particular product was found to be wanting, maybe revisiting and reevaluating that product would be a more productive conclusion. \nSummary\nDuring discussions and meetings at work you should focus on uncovering the following: \n\nWhat is the issue at hand?\nWhat is the conclusion?\nIs there a correspondence between issue and conclusion?\nShould I accept the conclusion given the statements supporting it?\n\n","id":"http://datadao.de/articles/2019/productive-discussions/","title":"Productive Discussions"},"http://datadao.de/articles/2020/":{"body":"","id":"http://datadao.de/articles/2020/","title":"文章"},"http://datadao.de/articles/2020/machine-learning-interpretability/":{"body":"My biggest takeaways from reading the book An Introduction to Machine Learning Interpretability are listed here.\n1. Reference for specific ML Interpretability Techniques\nThis is a decent quick reference for various MLI techniques. It list out 2D-projection techniques such as t-SNE, PCA and correlation graphs. It also gives short and quick one or two sentence summaries of white box modeling techniques such as decision trees and rule based models. It also delves into some visualization techniques and closes with sensitivity analysis and a few ways to test interpretability. When I say short, I do mean short, however, often the descriptions are less than half a page in length.\n2. Thinking about Global vs. Local interpretability\nAs I build models, I have a tendency to focus on the metrics for measuring the effectiveness of final predictions such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc. Often times, this can lead me to neglect useful methods for understanding what my model is doing at a local level. When I'm building a model, this means thinking not only of global state i.e. the relationship between input variables and target predictions over my entire dataset but also local dynamics. Thinking locally will be useful in terms of understanding model behaviour and I think this is often something I tend to neglect or do at a much later time. I tend to only do local investigation during debugging or in the process of improving global performance as opposed to actively engaging in local analysis from the start and this needs to change.\nFor instance, I think I should look at clusters of input records and their predictions or take predictions and look at those input clusters and build this into my explorative and developmental processes in a more active way.\n3. Performing Sensitivity Analysis\nWhen it comes to testing ML models we have our datasets and metrics, but if accuracy is improving but our ability to understand the reasoning behind such improvements decreases have we really gained anything? Oftentimes I think the answer will be no, since many models are used specifically for the purposes of augmenting human decision making capabilities.\nSensitivity Analysis perturbes or otherwise changes the input data and observes model behaviour in response to such changes. Building sensitivity analysis into our ML testing and evaluation pipelines from the start can help us recognize crazy deviations in model behaviour and build more robusts tests for outliers or potentially extremely rare events that we may have not yet observed.\n4. Testing Interpretability\nMy final takeaway is that I should start testing specifically for interpretability. This means simulating random data and ensuring my models do not generate compelling local explanations or reason codes. Also I can take known signal functions and simulate random data for that function and test that my model accurately represents explanations (both local and global) for the given signal.\nAlso robust models are not likely to change much given slight changes in the input variables, I should start testing for this as well to ensure that explanations are stable under slight input data modification.\n","id":"http://datadao.de/articles/2020/machine-learning-interpretability/","title":"Book Review Takeaways from Machine Learning Interpretability"},"http://datadao.de/contact/":{"body":"","id":"http://datadao.de/contact/","title":"联系"},"http://datadao.de/projects/":{"body":"QuantU\n\ncoming soon to a website near you!\n\n","id":"http://datadao.de/projects/","title":"项目"},"http://datadao.de/research/":{"body":"","id":"http://datadao.de/research/","title":"研究"},"http://datadao.de/whoami/":{"body":"My name is John and I'm a engineer, analyst and part-time scientist; also just another ape wandering around this planet so don't take me too seriously. In my free time, I enjoy applying quantitative methods to help improve and make sense of the world around me. Of course, I fail a lot and make tons of mistakes, but I guess that's to be expected and it does make for a nice feeling when something works the way it should and the world really has been improved or your understanding has increased in some significant way. \nI guess I'm somewhat of a nerd. I love books, films and games but mainly just great storytelling and engaging pieces of art. At one time in my life I was artist and had a lot of fun with it.\nI like detailed discussions and getting others exited about scientific discovery and quantitative fields - especially if it has something to do with applied mathematics, artificial intelligence or statistics.\nIf you'd like to talk to me about anything just hit me up on one of my social media accounts - I'll prolly be munching on banana somewhere :)\n","id":"http://datadao.de/whoami/","title":"关于我"}},"docInfo":{"http://datadao.de/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://datadao.de/articles/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://datadao.de/articles/2019/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://datadao.de/articles/2019/anchoring-bias-in-software-dev/":{"body":448,"title":4},"http://datadao.de/articles/2019/productive-discussions/":{"body":384,"title":2},"http://datadao.de/articles/2020/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://datadao.de/articles/2020/machine-learning-interpretability/":{"body":299,"title":6},"http://datadao.de/contact/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://datadao.de/projects/":{"body":5,"title":0},"http://datadao.de/research/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://datadao.de/whoami/":{"body":100,"title":0}},"length":11},"lang":"English"};
