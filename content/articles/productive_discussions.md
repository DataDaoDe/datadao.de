Often during meetings and discussions in software development and engineering arguments and reasons are put forward for preferring one method over another. 

Someone may suggest taking one approach and another engineer may ardently prefer a different solution. How can we evaluate each person's reasoning and arguments? It sounds like it might be simple - just evaluate what the person said, break it down into its constituent parts and analyze it. Unfortunately, it is not that simple. We often react to the manner in which things are said, whether loud, angrily, or softly and we bring our own beliefs and current state of mind to the situation - perhaps we didn't sleep well the night before and are just annoyed by the way the person is slowly communicating an idea.

These and many more factors cause us to fail to react rationally and keep us from reaching the full productive potential within our discussions.

## Concentrating on the Issue

One way to help us navigate the commucation space in a rational way is to think actively think about the issue at hand. The issue is the reason we are having the discussion, the stimulous for the argument, it could be a formal business question such as, "What is causing customer churn?" or "Would a majority of our users be interested in using feature X?" or "How much revenue will we have in 2025?". 

These are all examples of **descriptive issues** - they describe the state of the world, or at least present us with a model of the past, current or future state of the world. Its usually easier to maintain level headed discussions on descriptive issues. These are a matter of facts and data and building models based off of that data.

At the other end we have **prescriptive issues** - these describe how the world should be or ought to be. Examples are, "Should we use programming language X over language Y?", "Should we open a new store in city Z?", or "What should we do about failing to reach year-to-year growth projections?". These tend to be more emotionally laden and it can be difficult to discuss the issue rationally.

> **Key Insight #1** - focus on uncovering the issue and try to determine whether it is a prescriptive or descriptive one.

## Uncover the conclusion

It is impossible to evaluate a set of arguments unless we know the conclusion. Therefore, uncovering the conclusion is just as important as determining the underlying issue. We need to ask, "What is my interlocutor trying to prove?" or "What is their main point?". Often the conclusion is hidden in a set of statements and can only be inferred, but sometimes its stated up-front, for instance, "I think we should spend a sprint working to remove technical debt because ...".

> **Key Insight #2** - in order to accept or believe a conclusion, all the statements must support that conclusion.

To illustrate this, imagine the following statement: "We should hire a new PR manager to better communicate with the press. Why? Because we recently got feedback from someone who said our PR was poor quality." Does a single data point justify a new hire? Maybe it does, likely it does not. Who was the person? Was it the CEO of the company? Was it an intern? Does it matter? The main point here is that once you uncover the conclusion: "We should hire a new PR manager", and know the issue, "We have bad press." you can evaluate the facts which constitute the issue and the statements supporting the conclusion.

Also of importance is that there is a correspondence between issue and conclusion - this may sound fundamental but is often not the case.

> **Key Insight #3** - ensure there is a direct correspondence between issue and conclusion.

For instance, "We should throw more customer events to increase our brand image. Last year our NPS was higher than this year." If the issue is a decline in customer loyalty or satisfaction, how does this relate to brand image? Here you would want to dig deeper to discover the true underlying issue and then ask for more statements and arguments for the proposed conclusion given a more refined issue for instance, perhaps the real issue is that some customers left because a particular product was found to be wanting, maybe revisiting and reevaluating that product would be a more productive conclusion. 

## Summary

During discussions and meetings at work you should focus on uncovering the following: 

1. What is the issue at hand?
2. What is the conclusion?
3. Is there a correspondence between issue and conclusion?
4. Should I accept the conclusion given the statements supporting it?
