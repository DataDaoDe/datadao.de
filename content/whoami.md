My name is John and I'm a engineer, analyst and part-time scientist; also just another ape wandering around this planet so don't take me too seriously. In my free time, I enjoy applying quantitative methods to help improve and make sense of the world around me. Of course, I fail a lot and make tons of mistakes, but I guess that's to be expected and it does make for a nice feeling when something works the way it should and the world really has been improved or your understanding has increased in some significant way. 

I guess I'm somewhat of a nerd. I love books, films and games but mainly just great storytelling and engaging pieces of art. At one time in my life I was artist and had a lot of fun with it.

I like detailed discussions and getting others exited about scientific discovery and quantitative fields - especially if it has something to do with applied mathematics, artificial intelligence or statistics.

If you'd like to talk to me about anything just hit me up on one of my social media accounts - I'll prolly be munching on banana somewhere :)
