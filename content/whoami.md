My name is John and I'm a software engineer and data analyst. Academically and in my free time, I study the place where computer science intersects with medicine.

My research time is focused in associated medical informatics subfields like biomedical image analysis, bioinformatics, computational medicine and biostatistics but I also enjoy finding applications out of more theoretic areas such as mathematical modelling and systems science. 

I love detailed discussions, getting others exited about medical informatics, helping people improve their skills and watching them make advancements in our current medical knowledge and systems, and overall just helping to improve our current medical knowledge through my own abilities in computer science. If you'd like to talk to me about any of the above topics just drop me an e-mail or hit me up on social media.
