My name is John and I'm an engineer who builds AI and ML systems. Academically, I enjoy exploring pure and applied mathematics, but I'm also drawn to the physical sciences such as neuroscience, systems science and physics.

I have a life-long diversion with the arts, especially literature, design and music. And I am particularly interested in understanding and quantifying the nature of human perception and expression of the various art forms.

I enjoy building things in general and taking part in just about any sport or physical activity.

I love detailed discussions and if you'd like to talk about some of my work or the above topics just drop me an e-mail.
